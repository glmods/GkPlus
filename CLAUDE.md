# GkPlus - Gunlok Modding Framework

A 32-bit Windows DLL mod for the game **Gunlok** (2000). Built as a `d3d8.dll` proxy that hooks
into the game via Microsoft Detours, exposing game systems to Lua 5.4 scripting. The game binary
is actively being reverse engineered in Ghidra, accessible via MCP.

## Build

- **Platform**: Windows x86 only (32-bit). Enforced in CMakeLists.txt.
- **Standard**: C++20
- **Generator**: Ninja (via CMakePresets.json)
- **Package manager**: vcpkg (`x86-windows-static-md` triplet)
- **Output**: `d3d8.dll` (MODULE library, not a regular DLL)
- **Entry point offset**: `0x005e50c8` (used to compute base address at runtime)

```
cmake --preset builtin-vcpkg
cmake --build build
cmake --build build --target copy   # copies d3d8.dll to Gunlok's Steam directory
```

`cmake --build build` is incremental and quick. The `static_assert`s in `src/Actors.cpp` are the
check for any struct-layout or vtable edit — build after touching them rather than eyeballing.
`-Winvalid-offsetof` warnings on `Actor`/its subclasses and on `Map` are pre-existing and benign
(they are non-standard-layout due to virtuals); a clean build still links `d3d8.dll`. Every struct
modelled with pure virtuals produces them — that is the expected cost of the convention below, not
a signal to switch back to an explicit vtbl field.

## Architecture

### DLL Lifecycle (src/entry.cpp)

1. `DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)`:
   - Resolves global pointers (triggers, doors) via `GetObjectAtOffset`
   - Initializes Lua VM (`Lua::Init()`, `luaL_openlibs`)
   - Opens a Detours transaction, constructs all modules (which attach hooks), commits
   - Loads and executes `main.lua`
2. `DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_DETACH)`:
   - Opens Detours transaction, destroys modules (which detach hooks), commits
   - Closes Lua VM

### Lua Layer (src/Module.h, src/LuaEngine.h)

The CRTP module base, the concepts-based type interop, the Lua userdata wrappers and the
per-module API surface are documented in `lua_notes.md`.

### Function Calling Convention (src/Core.h)

Game functions are called via typed function pointers resolved at runtime:

```cpp
// Calling convention typedefs
CDecl<Ret, Args...>      // __cdecl
StdCall<Ret, Args...>    // __stdcall
FastCall<Ret, Args...>   // __fastcall
ThisCall<Ret, Args...>   // __thiscall

// Resolution: adds base address to offset, stores in pointer
GetObjectAtOffset(funcPtr, 0x004d4b50);  // resolves Print function
```

Base address is computed once: `actualEntryPoint - 0x005e50c8`.

### Detour Hooking (src/DetourUtils.h)

Wrapper templates around `::DetourAttach`/`::DetourDetach` that handle member function pointer
casting via `memcpy`. Used for `__thiscall` hooks on game objects.

Pattern: store original as function pointer, attach hook in constructor, detach in destructor.

## Source Files

### Core Infrastructure

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/entry.cpp` | DllMain, module instantiation order, global pointer setup |
| `src/Core.h/cpp` | `GetBaseAddress()`, `GetObjectAtOffset()`, `DebugWrite()` |
| `src/Module.h` | CRTP module base - auto-registers in Lua `package.preload` |
| `src/LuaEngine.h/cpp` | Lua VM init/close, type interop (concepts, Fields, Create) |
| `src/DetourUtils.h` | Member function DetourAttach/DetourDetach wrappers |
| `src/Varint.h` | Variable-length integer encode/decode (used for Lua refs in trigger scripts) |

### Lua-facing sources

The Lua userdata wrappers (`src/Actors`, `src/Roles`, `src/Map`, `src/Vulnerability`,
`src/Music`, `src/Math`) and the `gk.*` modules (`src/Console`, `src/Menu`, `src/Tokens`,
`src/Triggers`, `src/Misc`, `src/Music`, `src/Memory`, `src/GUI`, `src/Camera`, `src/Debug`,
`src/AI`) are tabulated with their APIs in `lua_notes.md`.

### Other

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/Chunks.h/cpp` | ChunksModule - hooks chunk registration (debug logging only, no Lua API, currently commented out in entry.cpp) |
| `src/InputFix.h/cpp` | InputFixModule - hook-only, no Lua API. Detours `AcquireDInputDevice` to suppress the vestigial DirectInput keyboard acquire and its `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook (see `input_notes.md`) |
| `src/ImGuiBindings.h/cpp` | ImGui C++ to Lua/JS bindings via imgui-quickjs |
| `src/Menus.inc.h` | X-macro listing all 36 Gunlok menus: `GUNLOK_MENU(Name, Id, TitleResourceId, "English title")`. There are no gaps - ids 11 and 14-20 are identified in `menu_system_notes.md` |
| `imgui-quickjs/` | Static library: QuickJS bindings for ImGui |

## Reverse Engineering Reference

### Detailed Documentation Files

- `lua_notes.md` - the Lua layer: `Module<Derived>` CRTP registration, the `LuaEngine` concepts/`Fields<>` interop, the userdata wrappers, every `gk.*` module's API, and the `gk.menu` surface
- `actor_vtable_notes.md` - Actor class hierarchy, all 83+ vtable slots, subclass sizes, constructor addresses
- `trigger_system_notes.md` - 22 trigger types, data structures, console command syntax, function addresses
- `gls_system_notes.md` - GLS/GSH script parser: pipeline, ParsedThingBase layout, per-section field tables (types/ranges/defaults), ToXxx converters, C++ API is `src/GLS.h`
- `level_loading_notes.md` - How a level is built: `BeginLevelSession` -> `LoadLevel` -> `ToMap`, the `.cut`/`.map`/`.opt`/`.loc` sidecar caches, the `LevelMeshHeader` geometry format, the `use <role> in team <n> for "<rif object>"` placed-object binding hash on `ParsedMap+0x1b60`, both spawn factories, and the three seams for replacing the `.gls` path with a native/Lua level builder
- `role_system_notes.md` - `Role` (0xc0) field-by-field: the entity hash table (0x007b48f0), lifecycle (`CreateRole`/`ToRole`/`RoleDtor`/`DestroyRoles`), the two embedded 16-byte list headers (vulnerabilities @ 0x68, sever points @ 0xac), the `flags` bitfield, `InventoryInfo`, pickup classification via `character->aggression*10`, the `ai` -> Actor-subclass dispatch (`CreateActor`), the spawn path (`SpawnRole`), and three `ToRole` defects
- `role_subobjects_notes.md` - the four `Role` sub-objects: `Character` (0xb8, with `ToCharacter`'s unit conversions), `Projectile` (0x20), `ParticleGenerator` (0xd4, GLS fields vs runtime animation channels), and the 3-variant `Destructibility` family (base 0x8 / `FragData` 0x24 / `ReplaceDestructibility` 0x10, dispatched on the `+0x04` tag by `Frag` @ 0x0052e220)
- `threading_model_notes.md` - Two game threads (main "client" + executor "server"), loopback message queues (full `MsgQueue`/`MsgQueueList`/`MsgQueueNode` layouts), pause handshake, per-thread clocks/RNG, which GkPlus hooks run on which thread, and the four script-execution entry points (all main-thread; host uses `ScriptQueue`, MP joiners use update `0x67`)
- `directplay_protocol_notes.md` - Multiplayer wire protocol: DirectPlay (`IDirectPlay4A`) COM/session setup, app GUID, SendEx/Receive framing & reliability, and the full command (client->server) and update (server->client) message-id tables with payload layouts, the `0x87` lock-step turn model, and update `0x67` (§8.11) which makes every client run a trigger script from its **own** local `Scripts\` copy
- `menu_system_notes.md` - Both menu systems (front-end `Menus[36]` + in-game `InGameMenus[7]`): `Menu`/`MenuListItem` layouts, the four item constructors and the 4 item types, the full 0-35 menu inventory with titles and populators, the (menu, item) -> action transition map, navigation/rendering/input, key bindings, and the localized string table
- `save_system_notes.md` - `.sav`/`.msv` savegame format: full field-by-field stream layout, the header-only "carry to next level" variant, the team carry-over roster, and why the console `SAVE`/`LOAD` commands are the demo system instead
- `input_notes.md` - Input subsystem: keyboard runs on Win32 `WM_KEYDOWN` (`MainWindowWndProc` -> `HandleKeyMessage` -> VK->DIK `VkToScanCodeTable` -> the universal `HandleKeyPress4` sink), mouse on Raw Input, and the DirectInput `SysKeyboard` is a vestigial acquired-but-never-read fossil whose `Acquire()` arms the `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook that lags system keyboard input under a debugger; the `gk.inputfix` module (`src/InputFix.cpp`) detours `AcquireDInputDevice` to suppress it
- `rif_chunk_format.md` - the `.rif` asset format: 12-byte chunk header, `REBCRIF1` Huffman
  container, all 105 registered chunk types, **and** the AvP upstream mapping (see below)
- `gls.txt` - Game Level Structure file format quick field list (superseded by gls_system_notes.md)

### Upstream Source: Aliens vs Predator (1999)

Gunlok's asset layer is Rebellion's `3dc` chunk library, and the **published AvP Gold source**
is available locally at `D:\Documenti\GitHub\aliens-vs-predator\source\AvP_vc\3dc`. This is
verified, not assumed: AvP's `huffman.cpp` decompresses 563/563 shipped `.rif` files, and 88 of
Gunlok's 105 registered chunk ids appear in that source. Use it as ground truth for anything
chunk/RIF-shaped instead of decompiling — `rif_chunk_format.md` has the id -> class/file map.

The split is sharp and worth remembering:

- **Shared** — the chunk/RIF library, `List<T>` (`list_tem.hpp`), `HashTable<T>`
  (`Hash_tem.hpp`), `Chunk`/`Chunk::Register` (`Chunk.hpp`), and the load-side consumers
  `avp/win95/Projload.cpp` + `Objsetup.cpp` (AvP's counterpart to `ToMap`).
- **Not shared** — the entire game layer. Roles, Actors, GLS scripts, triggers, menus and the
  save format have no AvP counterpart; AvP's `STRATEGYBLOCK`/`MODULE`/behaviour blocks do
  **not** describe Gunlok structures. Don't map them across.

Two gotchas when searching that tree: most `win95/` files have **uppercase** extensions, so
`grep --include=*.cpp` silently misses them (use `find -iname`); and AvP's debug `fail()` is
`#define fail if (0)` under `NDEBUG`, which is why shipped code has no bounds checks
(e.g. `Menu::GetItemData`).

### Ghidra Database Hygiene

Always leave the Ghidra database in a better state than you found it. Whenever you decompile
something, write your understanding back into the database instead of keeping it in the chat:

- Rename functions from `FUN_00xxxxxx` to descriptive names as soon as their purpose is clear
- Rename locals and parameters from `uVar1`/`param_1` to meaningful names, and set their types
- Define/refine structs and enums for the data being accessed, and apply them to the variables
  that use them (prefer this over leaving raw `*(int *)(param_1 + 0x50)` offset arithmetic)
- Name globals discovered along the way (`DAT_00xxxxxx` -> a real name)
- Add a plate comment on non-obvious functions summarizing what they do and their calling convention

Anything reusable (offsets, struct layouts, subsystem behavior) should also land in this file or
the relevant `*_notes.md`.

Read-only is **not enforced** on delegated work — a nested subagent renamed functions and globals
this session despite being told not to. If you fan out analysis, treat the constraint as advisory
and audit the DB afterwards rather than trusting it.

### Analysis Traps

- `StartExecutorThread` -> `ExecutorThreadProc` is a `CreateThread` **entry-point reference, not a
  call edge** — leave it in a caller-closure and every executor-only function falsely appears
  reachable from the main thread. Cut it; treat thread procs as roots.
- "No xrefs" often means the *referencing data was never defined* (vtables sitting as raw bytes).
  Scan for the little-endian pointer before concluding a virtual has no callers.
- Reachability and gate counts must be **transitive**: `CommandSpawn` looks ungated but delegates
  to `DoSpawn`, which holds the gate. Converges around depth 2.
- Read **disassembly** for computed sizes/arguments — the decompiler folds constants differently
  (`iVar + 0x48` vs the actual `LEA EDX,[EDI + 0x49]`).
- When extracting call arguments in bulk, take literals from the **same source line** as the
  buffer variable; pairing P-code operands positionally desyncs in multi-call-site functions.
- Bulk-recovering broadcast ids: scan each vtable slot body for the last `MOV dword [EBP+x], imm`
  before a `CALL BroadcastToPlayers` (0x00504bf0). Single-candidate sites are trustworthy — the
  scan independently reproduced every id already documented — but sites yielding 2+ candidates, or
  none, are computed (`0x41 + close_range`) and need disassembly.
- Verify against the Ghidra DB, not the `*_notes.md` — a claim in the notes is only as good as
  the measurement behind it, and not every one was measured.
- A **mistyped global pointer** makes the decompiler emit `Global[n].field_0xNN` shorthand whose
  real offset is `n * sizeof(wrong type) + 0xNN`. Retype the global before reading anything
  through it, and distrust notes written in `[n].field_` form.
- When sweeping accesses to a global struct, track the **offset carried in the register**
  (propagate through `MOV`/`LEA`/`ADD`/`SUB`, kill on other writes and on `CALL` for EAX/ECX/EDX).
  A plain `[reg+disp]` scan misses every field reached after an `ADD reg,imm` rebase. Sanity-check
  that all recovered offsets land inside the known struct size.
- Existing **names in the DB are not evidence either** — several shipped names described
  something the function does not do. Confirm a name against the body before building on it,
  and rename when it's wrong.
- A wrong name does not stay local. `save_system_notes.md` described the savegame `kind` field as
  "0 = player character" — inferred from a constructor name that does not exist in the binary —
  which made the format look impossible for any actor larger than 0x178. `kind` is just
  `IsProjectile()`. When a note calls something contradictory or broken, suspect the label first.
- A stub that decompiles to `return;` is **not necessarily a no-op**: check for `RET 0xN`. A
  non-zero operand means the function takes `N` bytes of stack arguments and discards them, which
  usually makes it a *setter* whose base implementation ignores the value. `Actor` slots 9 and 54
  were documented as per-tick callbacks for exactly this reason; both are `RET 0x4` and pair with
  getter slots 8 and 30.
- The decompiler's `Class::Method` header line does **not** always match
  `FunctionManager.getParentNamespace()`. Query the namespace; never read ownership off the C output.
- For a vtable slot, the owning class is the **shallowest** class whose vtable contains that
  address — not the most-derived one that inherits it. 55 of 249 Actor-family functions were filed
  under a descendant. Fixing `setParentNamespace` also repairs the `this` parameter type for free.
- Vtable **slot indices are branch-local**. Two classes deriving from a common base number their own
  extension slots from the same index, so a "rename slot N everywhere" sweep silently clobbers an
  unrelated method in a sibling branch (`PickupActor` slot 85 vs `MobileActor` slot 85).
- The **last** vtable in an adjacent run has no successor to bound it. `PresidentActor`'s
  (0x00669380) runs to the string pool at 0x00669500 — 96 slots, not the 84 that "ends at the next
  vtable" implies. Bound the final table with the reference test, never with adjacency.
- A `ParsedThingBase` subclass may be **larger than 0x1b60**: check the `malloc` size in its
  `DoParseXxx`. `ParsedMap` is 0x1b78 - the extra 0x18 is the placed-object binding hash.

### Ghidra MCP Mechanics

- `execute_command` runs in a **persistent** Jython context — globals survive between calls, so
  accumulate into a global and process in batches.
- 30 s timeout: >~15 decompilations per call times out. Batch with a `DONE` set so a timeout
  doesn't lose progress.
- `mem.getBytes()` into a Jython `bytearray` does not marshal back (silently returns zeros) — use
  `getInt()`/`getByte()` or `jarray`.
- `createLabel` replaces a dynamic `DAT_` symbol, deleting any `Symbol` handle fetched beforehand
  (`ConcurrentModificationException`) — re-fetch after.
- `findDataTypes` may return a pre-existing duplicate from another category; consolidate with
  `dtm.replaceDataType(old, new, False)` instead of leaving two definitions.
- Editing a struct field: `setFieldName` on an `undefined` component **silently does not persist**,
  and renaming a component *wider* than the field mislabels its neighbours (`MobileActor+0x187` was
  a 4-byte `int` spanning 0x188). Use `clearAtOffset` then
  `replaceAtOffset(off, dt, dt.getLength(), name, comment)`, and re-check `getLength()` afterwards —
  an unchanged struct size is the guard that the edit landed where you meant.
- For `__thiscall`, the `this` type comes from the function's **parent class namespace**
  (`setParentNamespace`), not `updateFunction`; a parameter literally named `this` binds to ECX.
- Ghidra's `__thiscall` puts **only** `this` in ECX, everything else on the stack. A function
  taking args in ECX *and* EDX is `__fastcall` — model it that way and check
  `getVariableStorage()` on each param afterwards. `updateFunction("__thiscall", ...)` also
  auto-inserts its own `this`, shifting your explicit params by one.
- After renaming in Ghidra, `grep` the `*.md` files for the old `FUN_`/`DAT_` name.
- A big function's decompilation can exceed the MCP result token cap (it auto-saves to a
  `tool-results` file needing chunked reads). Instead write it to the scratchpad via Jython
  (`open(p,'w').write(r.getDecompiledFunction().getC())`) then `Read` it — or hand that file to
  a subagent to summarize so a 1000+-line function never enters the main context.
- `getInt()`/`getBytes()` on an uninitialized `.data`/`.bss` global throws `MemoryAccessException`
  (zero-init globals aren't in the file image) — read meaning from writers/disassembly, not live bytes.

### Actor Class Hierarchy

```
Actor (0x120 bytes, vtbl @ 0x00667e30)
 +- MobileActor (0x230 bytes)
 |   +- CharacterActor (0x308 bytes)
 |   |   +- CentibodyActor (0x310 bytes)
 |   |   |   +- CentipedeActor (0x310 bytes)
 |   |   +- PopupActor (0x310 bytes)
 |   |   |   +- TurretActor (0x320 bytes)
 |   |   +- NodeActor (0x278 bytes)
 |   +- PresidentActor (0x240 bytes)
 +- PickupActor (0x150 bytes)
 +- TrackObjectActor (0x1b8 bytes)

 +- BackgroundCreatureActor (0x120 bytes)
 |   +- FlyingBackgroundCreatureActor (0x120 bytes)
 +- BlockerActor (0x130 bytes)
 +- ProjectileActor (0x178 bytes) see actor_vtable_notes.md
```

Key Actor struct offsets (vtable ptr implicit at 0x00): `id` @ 0x0c, `vulnerabilities` @ 0x10,
`ai_type` @ 0x50, `flags` @ 0x7c, `position` (Vec3) @ 0xa0, `orientation` (Vec4) @ 0xac,
`team_id` @ 0xbc, `role` @ 0xc0, `armor_value` @ 0xf0, `strength` @ 0xf4, `is_dead` @ 0x115.

No RTTI - type checking uses virtual methods (IsCharacter, IsMobile, IsTurret, etc.). Slots 36-50
are that mechanism and all fifteen are mapped to a concrete class.

Vtable slot counts: Actor 83, MobileActor 95, CharacterActor 100, TurretActor 105,
PresidentActor 96, PickupActor 86, ProjectileActor 85; the other nine add nothing. **Slot indices are
only comparable within a branch** - `PickupActor`'s slot 85 and `MobileActor`'s slot 85 are
unrelated. A slot implementation belongs to the *shallowest* class whose vtable holds it.

### Trigger Types Enum (TriggerKind)

| 1 | Location | Actor enters radius around coords |
| 2 | LocationSpecified | Specific actors enter location |
| 3 | LocationAll | All listed actors in location |
| 4 | LocationTimed | Location check with time component |
| 5 | InstantDeath | Immediate death trigger |
| 6 | InstantDisplace | Immediate displacement |
| 7 | Time | Fires after delay (game ticks) |
| 8 | Escort | Escort mission trigger |

### Role Structure (0xc0 bytes)

Full field-by-field breakdown, lifecycle, hash table and spawn dispatch in
`role_system_notes.md`. Key fields: `name` @ 0x00 (from GLS `identifier` 0x47, **not**
`name`), `shape` @ 0x18, `hierarchy` @ 0x1c, `hotspot` @ 0x44, `character` @ 0x60,
`inventory_info` @ 0x64, `vulnerabilities` list @ 0x68 (`{sentinel,count,cache,flag}`),
`flags` @ 0x78 (10 packed booleans), `ai` @ 0x7c (determines Actor subclass),
`resistance_factor` @ 0x94, `armor_value` @ 0x98, `shields` @ 0x9c, `sever_points` list
@ 0xac, `id` @ 0xbc. The C++ mirror is `src/Roles.cpp`.

### Map Structure (0x18c bytes)

Full layout in `level_loading_notes.md`; the C++ mirror is `src/Map.cpp`, modelled as
`Map : MapBase, RefCountedBase` (see the vtable convention above). Key fields:
`lock` @ 0x04 (embedded RWLock), `sections`/`num_sections` @ 0x88/0x8c, the second
base subobject's vptr/`refcount` @ 0xa4/0xa8, `adjacency_built` @ 0xac, `scene_object` @ 0xc8, `bitmap`
@ 0xcc, `neg_origin` @ 0x11c, `bounds_min`/`bounds_max` @ 0x128/0x134,
`camera_focus_min`/`max` @ 0x140/0x14c, `.rif` FILETIME @ 0x158, `shadow_object_rif`/
`_name` @ 0x160/0x164, `default_position` @ 0x168, `sky_object` @ 0x188.

**The origin at 0x11c is stored negated** (`Map_Ctor` XORs each component with
0x80000000) and `ToMap` *adds* it, so a placed object lands at
`rif_pos * world_unit_scale - origin`. 0x24..0x88 and 0x8c..0xa4 are still unmapped -
they are reached only through `__thiscall` methods called directly on `TheMap`.

Roles are the "entity" hash @ 0x007b48f0 (`{num_entities, num_buckets, mask, buckets}`);
ids come from `next_entity_id` @ 0x007b48d4. `CreateRole` @ 0x004add90 allocates+inserts;
`ToRole` @ 0x0047cc20 converts a parsed `role`; `CreateActor` @ 0x00510760 dispatches
`role->ai` to the Actor subclass; `SpawnRole` @ 0x00503710 is `gk.roles` `Role:spawn`.

### Imports

Key external libraries: BINKW32.DLL (video), STEAM_API.DLL, D3D8.DLL,
KERNEL32/USER32/GDI32/ADVAPI32/OLE32/WINMM (Windows API).

## Conventions

- Everything lives in the `gk` namespace
- Game addresses are always offsets added to base address (never hardcoded absolutes)
- Hash tables (actors, roles) use bucket arrays with linked list chaining
- Linked lists (triggers, tokens) are doubly-linked with sentinel nodes
- Detour hooks follow: resolve original -> attach in constructor -> detach in destructor
- `static_assert` on struct sizes and offsets to catch layout mismatches
- Game vtables are modelled in `src/Actors.cpp` as **declaration-ordered pure virtuals**: the base
  `Actor` declares 83 (slot 0 is the destructor), and each subclass appends its own extension slots
  in vtable order. Adding a virtual there is how you record a new slot — it costs no object size
  (the vptr already exists), so the `static_assert(sizeof(...))` guards still hold and will catch a
  mistake. Cross-check slot numbers against `actor_vtable_notes.md`.
- **A struct with a vtable gets pure virtuals, never an explicit `void *vtbl` member.** Declare the
  slots as `virtual ... = 0;` in vtable order and let the implicit vptr occupy offset 0x00 — the
  first *data* member then starts at 0x04 (see `Actor`'s `unk1`, `Map`'s `lock`). An explicit vtbl
  field would double-count those 4 bytes and, worse, hides the slots. Slots whose purpose is not
  yet known follow the field convention: `StubN()` (as in `Actor::Stub27`).
- **A second vptr mid-struct means multiple inheritance — model it with real C++ inheritance**,
  not a `void *sub_vtbl` field. MSVC lays base subobjects out in declaration order, so the second
  vptr lands at exactly the right offset once the first base is sized correctly (`Map : MapBase,
  RefCountedBase` puts `RefCountedBase`'s vptr at 0xa4 because `sizeof(MapBase) == 0xa4`). Add a
  `static_assert(sizeof(...))` per base plus `offsetof` on a member of each — those are what
  prove the layout, and they fail loudly if the split is wrong.
  One deliberate exception: `gls::ParsedThingVtbl` models the vtable as a struct of typed
  function pointers *on purpose*, because GkPlus calls those slots rather than just describing them.
- Determining a vtable's **slot count**: MSVC emits every class's vftables adjacently in `.rdata`,
  so the table ends at the next address that is referenced *at all*. Walk the candidate slots and
  count references per dword: a real slot has **zero** (nothing points into the middle of a
  vtable), a boundary has some. `Map`'s secondary vtable at 0x00652828 is 2 slots — 0x0065282c has
  no refs, 0x00652830 has six from unrelated classes. "Looks like a function pointer" is not a
  slot test: past a table's end sit the one-slot vtables of the list/node helpers, then floats.
- Fields with a known offset but unknown meaning are named `field0xNN` / `unkN[...]` padding; a
  getter/setter of unknown purpose is named `GetField0xNN` / `SetField0xNN`
- Enum-like `int` fields use `enum class Name : int` (near its struct, or a header if shared across
  files) applied to the field; only encode values you've **verified** (the game's own enum, or a
  keyword->id function like `GetParticleIDFromName`) — leave `int` rather than guess a mapping.

## Git Workflow

**Commit directly to `main` when working in the primary checkout.** This overrides the default
"if on the default branch, branch first" behavior — do not create a branch and do not ask.

Only work on a separate branch when inside a dedicated git worktree, which will already be on
its own branch (see the worktree build notes: `VCPKG_ROOT` is unset there, so reuse the main
build's `vcpkg_installed` with manifest install disabled).

Committing still happens only when explicitly asked.

### Shell quoting for commit messages

The Bash and PowerShell tools need different multi-line quoting, and mixing them up produces a
partially-executed command rather than a clean error:

- Bash: `git commit -F - <<'MSGEOF' … MSGEOF`
- PowerShell: `git commit -m @' … '@` with the closing `'@` at column 0

Also: prefix `python3` with `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` when printing non-ASCII on Windows, and use
forward-slash paths inside Bash heredocs (`'\\'` gets collapsed). `/tmp` does not exist — use the
scratchpad directory.
